# Sentimental-Analysis-on-HealthCare-Review
## Project Overview
This project performs sentiment analysis to classify text data into categories like positive, negative, or neutral sentiment. By applying natural language processing (NLP) techniques, the model can analyze text data and predict sentiment, making it useful for applications such as social media monitoring, customer feedback analysis, and more.

## Features
Data Preprocessing: Text data is cleaned and preprocessed, including tokenization, stemming/lemmatization, and removal of stop words.
Model Training: Machine learning models, such as logistic regression, SVM, or deep learning models, are used for sentiment classification.
Evaluation: The model's accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score are evaluated to measure performance.
## Technologies Used
Python: Main programming language.

NLP Libraries: NLTK, spaCy, or transformers for text processing and analysis.

Machine Learning Libraries: Scikit-learn, TensorFlow, or PyTorch.

Jupyter Notebook: For experimentation and visualization of the process.

Machine Learning model: Logistic Regression. Trasnform Models can also be used.
